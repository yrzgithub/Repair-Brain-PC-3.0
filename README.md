## The Problem

    * The major problem in overcoming addictions or compulsions (physical or psychological) is forgetting our goal ie..To become independent.
    * Forgetting denies us from breaking the addiction cycle and it continues.
    * We didn't know whether we are progressing or not.
    * We fail to replace our addictive habits.

## How does this app help?

    * The app regularly tracks whether you are free or addicted.
